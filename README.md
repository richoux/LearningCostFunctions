## How to:

1. Compile the main program to learn Cost Functions.\
$> cd learn\
$> ./compile_learn_ga.sh

2. Run the main program to learn Cost Functions.\
$> (in learn folder)\
$> ./bin/learn_cf_ga (and many options, type -h first to have them)

3. Run the main program to learn Cost Functions using precomputed **incomplete** constraint spaces.\
$> (in learn folder)\
$> ./bin/learn_cf_ga -i spaces/the_file_you_want (plus many other options, type -h first to have them)

4. Run the main program to learn Cost Functions using precomputed **complete** constraint spaces.\
$> (in learn folder)\
$> ./bin/learn_cf_ga -ci spaces/complete_the_file_you_want (plus many other options, type -h first to have them)

5. Re-run Experiment 1\
$> (in learn folder)\
$> ./run_complete_space_xp.sh (then relax and wait for one hour or so)

6. Re-run Experiment 2\
$> (in learn folder)\
$> ./run_xp.sh (then relax and wait for two weeks or so)

7. Re-run Experiment 3\
$> (in problems/sudoku folder)\
/* Compile the three models first */\
$> ./compile_sudoku_nocfn.sh ; ./compile_sudoku.sh ; ./compile_sudoku_handmade.sh\
$> ./run_sudoku_xp.sh (then relax and wait for 10 minutes or so)

8. Analyse result files from Experiments 1 and 2\
$> (in learn folder)\
$> ./analyse_runs.sh results/the_file_you_want

9. Analyse result files from Experiment 3\
$> (in problems/sudoku folder)\
$> ./analyse_results.rb results/the_file_you_want
