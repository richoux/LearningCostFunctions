How to:

1. Compile the main program to learn Cost Functions.
$> cd learn
$> ./compile_learn_ga.sh

2. Run the main program to learn Cost Functions.
$> (in learn folder)
$> ./bin/learn_cf_ga (and many options, type -h first to have them)

3. Run the main program to learn Cost Functions using precomputed constraint spaces.
$> (in learn folder)
$> ./bin/learn_cf_ga -i spaces/the_file_you_want (plus many other options, type -h first to have them)

4. Re-run our experiments
$> (in learn folder)
$> ./run_xp.sh (then relax and wait for a week or so)

5. Analyse result files
$> (in learn folder)
$> ./analyse_runs.sh results/the_file_you_want
